Development:
    Frontend:
        React.js

        Entry Point: App.js

    Backend:
        Node.js

        Entry Point: index.js

    External API's used:
        Firebase Auth: To handle login/register
        MongoDB/Mongoose: To handle storing user data
        JSearch: To acquire job postings from external sites.
            Note: There is a complete backend for this, under '/jobs/external'. However,
            the frontend team was unable to implement a frontend for this feature.






To run backend:
    From the root directory:
        cd backend
        npm install
        npm start

    Navigate into the 'backend' directory and, into the terminal, do 'npm install' to download all required packages. Then,
        do 'npm start" to initialize the backend. It should begin hosting on http://localhost:2000/


To run frontend:
    From the root directory:
        cd frontend
        npm install
        npm start

    Navigate into the 'frontend' directory and, in the terminal, do 'npm install' to download all required packages. Then,
        do 'npm start" to initialize the frontend. If this is successful, a React page should pop up in your browser.
